When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I need to work with other people and share project with them or when I need to do some change one project but I haven't access to my local repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

To do not mix up something cause it is possible not only you can make commits on repository, so you need to know when to pull commits.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks used in GitHub to make copies from one use to another, clone used with git command, branches are common ideal for both remote and local.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

So if someone with whom you colleborate makes changes it can be cause of confilcts, so you can see conflicts and resolve them.
