When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I need to work with other people and share project with them or when I need to do some change one project but I haven't access to my local repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

To do not mix up something cause it is possible not only you can make commits on repository, so you need to know when to pull commits.
